#  ZeroScript Bridge
#  Local WebSocket <-> Roblox Studio MCP server.
#  The browser extension talks to this over ws://127.0.0.1:<PORT>.
#
#  What this bridge exposes to Kimi (aggregated into one tools/list):
#    - Every MCP server declared in config.json (by default: roblox), each
#      spawned as a stdio child and routed by tool name.
#
#  Design goals (robustness first):
#   - Each MCP stdio process is read by ONE dedicated thread; responses are
#     matched by JSON-RPC id (no "read the next line and hope" races).
#   - stderr is drained so a child never blocks on a full pipe.
#   - A dead server is auto-restarted and the failing call retried once.
#   - Tool calls are locked PER SERVER, so a slow server never blocks another.
#   - Every call ALWAYS produces a reply: a result OR a structured error.
#     Nothing ever hangs the agentic loop silently.

    check_studio_port waves the zombie through too (its path IS under Roblox).
    Our fresh StudioMCP can't own the port, Studio never re-registers on its
    own -> 0 tools forever, no restart order can fix it by hand.

    Ownership is decided by PID, not heuristics: we know the PID of the
    launcher we spawned (client.proc), so a StudioMCP.exe holding the port
    outside that process tree is a leftover by definition - Studio open or
    not. If the process tree can't be read, we do nothing (never risk killing
    our own healthy child on bad data). Returns True if a zombie was killed;
    the caller must then restart the roblox proxy (safe here even with Studio
    open: the plugin's single registration already went to the zombie, so
    there is no attempt left for a restart to collide with) AND tell the user
    to open Assistant Settings > MCP Servers so the plugin re-registers.

#
# TWO LEVELS (validated live 2026-06):

#    is connected to the MCP (app closed, OR its "Studio as MCP Server" option is
#    disabled - the two are indistinguishable at this layer). A non-empty list
#    means a Studio app IS connected, BUT note its entry stays present (active:true)
#    even when no place is open - only its "name" goes null. So presence != usable.
#  - get_studio_state: tells whether a PLACE is actually loaded. With a place open
#    it returns "Available DataModels: ..."; with the Studio on the home screen (or
#    the active place closed) it returns "...doesn't have a place opened / previously
#    active Studio has disconnected". That is the authoritative "place loaded" signal

        also means a user whose Studio is simply closed or whose MCP toggle is off
        waits ~48s before the terminal tells them what to do (the extension, which
        reads status over the socket, already says it immediately). So after a
        short grace we check independently and, if still not connected, show the
        step now. If Studio then attaches, studio_watch prints the green
        'connected' line - so an early banner is at worst redundant, never wrong
        (the user confirmed a premature toggle hint during boot is harmless).

        Deliberately does NOT try to distinguish 'Studio closed' from 'MCP toggle
        off': probe_studio can't tell them apart (both read app=False, see its
        docstring), and the banner wording already covers both, so there is no
        finer detection to preserve here. A proven port-squatter case is left to
        _boot_and_diagnose / studio_watch, which print their own, more specific
